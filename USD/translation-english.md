Why Monero?

Private

Unlike Bitcoin, or any of the other top
coins which make all transactions public,
Monero transactions are inherently
private and untraceable by default.

Secure

Through the use of advanced
cryptographic techniques, the receipt
of payments is secure and unalterable.

Accepted

Send payments to anyone locally or
worldwide without expensive fees or
waiting times.

Decentralized

Anyone can mine Monero using a
computer to process transactions. This
is why Monero is a community currency
that is not issued, manipulated or
controlled by a central authority.

Fungible

Each unit of Monero is exactly the
same as another because there is no
history that shows where it was used,
and by whom.

Separate Money and State

“We can't take money violently out
of the hands of government, all we
can do is by some sly roundabout
way, introduce something that they
can't stop.”

- Friedrich A. Hayek

"...soon be developed, is a reliable
e-cash, a method whereby on the
internet you can transfer funds... the
way in which I can take a $20 bill and
hand it over to you, with no record of
where it came from."

- Milton Friedman
