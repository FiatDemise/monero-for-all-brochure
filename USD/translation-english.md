Why Monero?

Private

Unlike Bitcoin, or any of the other top coins which make all transactions public, Monero transactions are inherently private and untraceable by default.

Secure

Through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques, the receipt of payments is secure and unalterable.

Accepted

Send payments to anyone locally or worldwide without expensive fees orwaiting times.

Decentralized

Anyone can mine Monero using a computer to process transactions. This is why Monero is a community currency that is not controlled, manipulated or issued by a central authority.

Valued

Over the last 5 years (2018-2023), Monero has gained 218% vs the US dollar.
